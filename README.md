### Express Challenge
Rocket, The React Rascal, (not to be confused with his twin brother, The Router Rascal) has struck spaceship mission control. Per his calling card, he has only done damage to the mission control's `component` files, so only make changes to those files. He couldn't help himself, and has left some punny hints behind.

**Only change lines that have hints on them!**

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork onto your computer.
2. Install the project's node dependencies by navigating to the project and running the command `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start the application. Go to `localhost:3000` to view it.
4. The current site is broken and has 6 errors that can be fixed by editing 6 lines of code (each of these lines has a comment that is a hint). If you find yourself doing a major rewrite, you've probably gone too far.
5. When the site is back up and running, it should look like it did before. You should be able to add a new spaceship part to the list when everything is done.
