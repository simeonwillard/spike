# Spike


## Description
This is the spike for my solo project.  I made a simple recipe search app with edamam api.  The user can search for recipes and the recipes are displayed in cards.  The user can then click the "go to recipe" button on the card and go to the original recipe website.  The user can also click the "ingredients" button on the card to see the list of ingredients for that recipe.
